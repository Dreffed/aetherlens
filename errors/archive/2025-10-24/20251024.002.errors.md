```

### Run Tests

- *Install Dependencies*

```
The conflict is caused by:
    pytest 7.4.3 depends on packaging
    black 23.11.0 depends on packaging>=22.0
    mkdocs 1.5.3 depends on packaging>=20.5
    safety 2.3.5 depends on packaging<22.0 and >=21.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
