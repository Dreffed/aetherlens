## Issue: Black Formatting Check Failed

### Problem Description
The GitHub CI Pipeline was failing at the "Lint Code" step with black formatter reporting:

```
Run black --check src/ tests/
would reformat /home/runner/work/aetherlens/aetherlens/src/aetherlens/config.py

Oh no! üí• üíî üí•
1 file would be reformatted, 14 files would be left unchanged.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

### Root Cause
The `database_url` field in `src/aetherlens/config.py` was formatted across multiple lines, but Black's formatter prefers to keep it on a single line since it fits within the line length limit.

### Solution
Reformatted the `database_url` field definition to be on a single line.

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/aetherlens/config.py` (lines 25-27)

**Before:**
```python
    # Database
    database_url: str = Field(
        default="postgresql://postgres:changeme@localhost:5432/aetherlens"
    )
    database_pool_size: int = 10
```

**After:**
```python
    # Database
    database_url: str = Field(default="postgresql://postgres:changeme@localhost:5432/aetherlens")
    database_pool_size: int = 10
```

### Explanation
Black prefers the most compact representation that fits within the line length limit (default 88 characters). Since the entire field definition fits on one line, Black consolidates it.

### Testing
Verified with:
```bash
./venv/Scripts/python -m black --check src/aetherlens/config.py
```

Output:
```
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file would be left unchanged.
```

### Related Issues
- Error documented in: `errors/20251024.005.errors.md`

### Notes
- Black is an opinionated formatter with minimal configuration options
- It's best to let Black decide formatting rather than fighting its choices
- Using `black --diff` locally before committing helps catch these issues early
