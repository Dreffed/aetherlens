## Strategic Alignment

### Project Direction: Open Source Home Lab Project

All documentation reflects the pivot to:

- **Target Market:** Home lab enthusiasts, smart home users, self-hosters
- **Use Cases:** Energy monitoring, cost tracking, smart home optimization, personal cloud costs
- **Philosophy:** Privacy-first, local-only by default, community-driven
- **Technology:** Python (AI-friendly), TimescaleDB, Docker, plugin architecture

### Key Differentiators

1. **Privacy-Focused:** 100% local processing, no cloud required
1. **Resource-Efficient:** Runs on Raspberry Pi 4 with \<2GB RAM
1. **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extensible via community plugins
1. **Multi-Domain:** Smart home + personal cloud costs in one platform
1. **Learning Platform:** Excellent for showcasing full-stack skills

## Architecture Decisions Highlighted

### ADR-001: Python Core Instead of Rust

**Rationale:** AI-assisted development, faster iteration, easier community contributions **Trade-off:** Slightly higher
resource usage, acceptable for home lab scale

### ADR-002: TimescaleDB Over InfluxDB

**Rationale:** Single database for time-series + config, SQL familiarity **Trade-off:** Slightly less optimal than
purpose-built InfluxDB

### ADR-003: Process Isolation Over In-Process Plugins

**Rationale:** Security, fault tolerance, resource limits **Trade-off:** Higher memory overhead (~30MB per plugin)

### ADR-004: REST-Only API (No GraphQL in v1.0)

**Rationale:** Simpler, faster development, better tooling **Trade-off:** May need multiple API calls for complex
queries

### ADR-005: Local-First, Cloud-Optional

**Rationale:** Privacy, reliability, no hosting costs **Trade-off:** No cloud-based features without user setup

## Counter-Perspectives Considered

### 1. Python vs. Rust Core

**Pro-Rust Arguments:**

- Better performance (100k vs 10k metrics/sec)
- Lower memory usage (50MB vs 200MB)
- Memory safety guarantees

**Counter:**

- AI tools struggle with Rust
- Home lab scale doesn't need extreme performance
- Can optimize hot paths in Rust later
- **Decision:** Python for v1.0, Rust for optimization in future

### 2. TimescaleDB vs. InfluxDB

**Pro-InfluxDB Arguments:**

- Purpose-built for time-series
- Better query language (Flux)
- Excellent retention and rollup policies

**Counter:**

- Requires separate database for config
- Learning curve for Flux
- TimescaleDB handles requirements well
- **Decision:** TimescaleDB for simplicity

### 3. REST vs. GraphQL

**Pro-GraphQL Arguments:**

- Flexible queries
- Reduces API versioning
- Great for complex UIs

**Counter:**

- Slower development for MVP
- Home lab UIs are relatively simple
- REST has better tooling
- **Decision:** REST for v1.0, GraphQL if needed later

### 4. In-Process vs. Isolated Plugins

**Pro-In-Process Arguments:**

- Lower memory overhead
- Faster communication
- Simpler architecture

**Counter:**

- Plugin crashes affect core
- Harder to enforce resource limits
- Security concerns
- **Decision:** Process isolation for stability and security
