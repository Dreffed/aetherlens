# GitHub Actions Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Ready to Test

---

## 🎯 Summary of Actual Errors Found

Based on the error log in `errors/20251024 - Github.md`, we identified and fixed the following specific issues:

### 1. **Lint Errors** ❌ → ✅

#### Error 1: UP045 - Use `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`
**Location:** `src/aetherlens/config.py:43`

```python
# BEFORE (error)
redis_url: Optional[RedisDsn] = Field(default=None)

# AFTER (fixed)
redis_url: RedisDsn | None = Field(default=None)
```

**Fix:** Updated to use Python 3.10+ union type syntax (`X | None`) instead of `typing.Optional[X]`

---

#### Error 2: F401 - Unused import
**Location:** `tests/conftest.py:6`

```python
# BEFORE (error)
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient  # Imported but never used

# AFTER (fixed)
# Import removed - will be added back when needed
```

**Fix:** Removed unused import that was a placeholder for future use

---

### 2. **Dependency Resolution Error** ❌ → ✅

#### Error: ResolutionImpossible
**Cause:** Pin ned exact versions (`==`) can conflict when pip tries to resolve dependencies

**Fix:** Changed all requirements to use version ranges instead of exact pins

```python
# BEFORE (problematic)
fastapi==0.104.1
pydantic==2.5.0

# AFTER (flexible)
fastapi>=0.104.0,<0.115.0
pydantic>=2.5.0,<3.0.0
```

**Benefits:**
- Allows pip to resolve compatible versions
- More resilient to dependency conflicts
- Follows semantic versioning best practices
- Still prevents breaking changes (uses major version caps)

---

### 3. **Security Scan Error** ❌ → ✅

#### Error: Deprecated action version
**Location:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
# BEFORE (deprecated)
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

# AFTER (current)
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

**Fix:** Updated to v4 which is the currently supported version

**Note:** This was causing the entire security scan job to fail before it could run

---

### 4. **Test Infrastructure** ⚠️ → ✅

#### Issue: No tests existed
**Status:** Tests would pass but with 0% coverage and "no tests collected" warning

**Fix:** Created minimal test suite:

1. **`tests/unit/__init__.py`** - Package marker
2. **`tests/unit/test_config.py`** - Configuration testing (3 tests)
3. **`tests/unit/test_version.py`** - Version and metadata testing (4 tests)
4. **`tests/integration/__init__.py`** - Package marker
5. **`tests/integration/test_placeholder.py`** - Placeholder integration tests (3 tests)

**Total Tests Added:** 10 tests
**Expected Coverage:** ~35-40%

## Lint Errors Fixed
- Update type hint from Optional[X] to X | None (Python 3.10+ syntax)
- Remove unused TestClient import from tests/conftest.py

## Dependency Resolution Fixed
- Change all requirements from pinned (==) to ranges (>=,<)
- Allows pip to resolve compatible versions
- Prevents dependency conflicts while maintaining stability

## GitHub Actions Updated
